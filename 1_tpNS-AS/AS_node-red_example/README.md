# Node-RED Application Server Example

This folder presents a simple Node-RED example flow for an Application Server that receives http push messages from 
ThingPark Wireless or ThingPark Enterprise network server and stores it in a local text file.

In order to try this Node-RED example you need a Node-RED server that you can install either on your own machine locally or use it on IBM Cloud.  
For more information on how to install a Nore-RED and import flows read our [Node-RED quick-start guide](../../docs/Node-RED-quick-start.md).
