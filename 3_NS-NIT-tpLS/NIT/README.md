# Network Interface Translator

This folder includes source codes of a Network Interface Translator (NIT) between different 3rd party Network Servers (NS) and 
ThingPark Location Solver (tpLC).

Most of the examples are in the form of Node-RED flows. In order to try them you need a Node-RED server that you can install either on your own machine locally or use it on IBM Cloud.  
For more information on how to install a Nore-RED and import flows read our [Node-RED quick-start guide](../../docs/Node-RED-quick-start.md).
