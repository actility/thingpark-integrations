# Node-RED quick start guide

## Installing a Node-RED Server

We recommend you either installing a Nede-RED server on your own computer/server machine locally or test in on IBM cloud.  
The process of local installation is described here:  
https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local

If you prefer to test the solution on IBM cloud follow the procedure explined under the following link.  
https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/ibmcloud

In case you just want to have a quick look at the flows without testing and/or modifying them, have a look at the read-only pre-installed examples at the following link:

## Installing sample flows

All samples of this repository are stored in JSON files that you can import into your Node-RED installation as described under the following link:
